Operating Systems C Programming Assignment 3

The goal of this assignment was to pass a variety of tests having to do with memory allocation and deallocation.  The process for doing so was to take the files given by Professor Ivo, and pass all of the tests.  Currently, the test that is not passing is the Stress test, however all the other basic tests are passing.

The main code is a small snippet designed to run the test_suite.  mem_pool.c contains all the implementation of the mem_pool.h functions. test_suite.h starts up the test_suite and a few functions.  test_suite.c has all the functionality and is set up and designed to pass the tests. The majority of the "heavy" code is in test_suite.c

Overall, the program provided useful knowledge about how memory allocation and deallocation works, and is a good beginning into the learning of Pintos.

The project was tested on both a Windows and a Virtual Machine (Ubuntu) environment.  Virtual Machine environment given by Ivo Georgiev.
